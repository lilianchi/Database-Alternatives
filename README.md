### Database Alternatives
The business owner Mrs. Benedict was struggling with managing designer work and their work hours to the corresponding task. The lack of management results in the difficulty of keeping track with the project process and the hurdle of calculating the allocation of payroll cost based on each project. Furthermore, Mrs. Benedict currently has to calculate the payroll of the designers manually, timing up the hourly wage to every single time slot on the timesheet from different designers individually, and then sum up to import corresponding information to the accounting system for further payments.
In the post-Covid days, Mrs. Benedict also realized that people are less willing to pay for putting their house interior; therefore, she would like to make some suggestions about how to retain previous customers and keep track of both the labor and operating expenses. By building up a database, the payroll process in Mrs. Benedict’s business could be dramatically improved in several aspects. Firstly, calculations could be automatically made in the database, reducing the possibility of misstatement due to manual process. Furthermore, leveraging the power of the database, Mrs. Benedict could easily make queries to group data in different ways to follow up on either designers’ working hours or project process at any point of time. Moreover, information could be stored in an organized way and easily retrieved to make additional decisions, such as budgeting the cost of a future project based on historical data and how much time and resources should be devoted in certain cases, collecting valuable information about the vendors and customers, and tracking operating expenses and labor performance.

### Dataset description
Right now, the company provides five datasets, some of which are paper documents, and some of which are excel files. The first one is called the Task dataset. It includes the task name, the related contacting customer information, and corresponding designers responsible for this task. However, this dataset is quite messy because the task name is irregular and it is combined by the customer name and some descriptions. Redundant issues are also common since several tasks might belong to one customer, but contact information is repeatedly recorded.
We also received a Designer dataset that includes the designer's wage, position, and private information. These two above datasets are all related to a timesheet data set. That is, it tells us which designer works on which project at a specific time period. Vendor data set is a dataset containing all information of vendors that the company once cooperated with. The Checks dataset includes the money checks that the company has signed, including checks signed for the designers and the vendors.
